Frans Kafka	The Castle	I dream of a grave, deep and narrow, where we could clasp each other in our arms as with clamps, and I would hide my face in you and you would hide your face in me, and nobody would ever see us any more.
Cormac McCarthy	The Road	Once there were brook trout in the streams in the mountains. You could see them standing in the amber current where the white edges of their fins wimpled softly in the flow. They smelled of moss in your hand. Polished and muscular and torsional. On their backs were vermiculate patterns that were maps of the world in its becoming. Maps and mazes. Of a thing which could not be put back. Not be made right again. In the deep glens where they lived all things were older than man and they hummed of mystery.
Cormac McCarthy	The Road	Keep a little fire burning; however small, however hidden.
Cormac McCarthy	The Road	There is no God and we are his prophets
Cormac McCarthy	The Road	What's the bravest thing you ever did?\nHe spat in the road a bloody phlegm. Getting up this morning, he said.
Cormac McCarthy	The Road	He walked out in the gray light and stood and he saw for a brief moment the absolute truth of the world. The cold relentless circling of the intestate earth. Darkness implacable. The blind dogs of the sun in their running. The crushing black vacuum of the universe. And somewhere two hunted animals trembling like ground-foxes in their cover. Borrowed time and borrowed world and borrowed eyes with which to sorrow it.
Cormac McCarthy	The Road	Then they set out along the blacktop in the gunmetal light, shuffling through the ash, each the other's world entire.
Cormac McCarthy	Blood Meridian	The ragged sparks blew down the wind. The prairie about them lay silent. Beyond the fire it was cold and the night was clear and the stars were falling. The old hunter pulled his blanket about him. I wonder if there's other worlds like this, he said. Or if this is the only one.
Cormac McCarthy	Blood Meridian, or the Evening Redness in the West	They were watching, out there past men's knowing, where stars are drowning and whales ferry their vast souls through the black and seamless sea.
Cormac McCarthy	Blood Meridian, or, the Evening Redness in the West	It makes no difference what men think of war, said the judge. War endures. As well ask men what they think of stone. War was always here. Before man was, war waited for him. The ultimate trade awaiting its ultimate practitioner. That is the way it was and will be. That way and not some other way.
Cormac McCarthy	The Road	Then they set out along the blacktop in the gunmetal light, shuffling through the ash, each the other's world entire.
Cormac McCarthy	The Road	Listen to me, he said, when your dreams are of some world that never was or some world that never will be, and you're happy again, then you'll have given up. Do you understand? And you can't give up, I won't let you.
Cormac McCarthy	All the Pretty Horses	There is no forgiveness. For women. A man may lose his honor and regain it again. But a woman cannot. She cannot.
Cormac McCarthy	The Road	Where men can't live gods fare no better.
Cormac McCarthy	No Country for Old Men	How does a man decide in what order to abandon his life?
Cormac McCarthy	All the Pretty Horses	Long before morning I knew that what I was seeking to discover was a thing I'd always known. That all courage was a form of constancy. That it is always himself that the coward abandoned first. After this all other betrayals come easily.
Cormac McCarthy	All the Pretty Horses	He thought that in the beauty of the world were hid a secret. He thought that the world’s heart beat at some terrible cost and that the world’s pain and its beauty moved in a relationship of diverging equity and that in this headlong deficit the blood of multitudes might ultimately be exacted for the vision of a single flower.
Cormac McCarthy	Blood Meridian, or, the Evening Redness in the West	The man who believes that the secrets of the world are forever hidden lives in mystery and fear. Superstition will drag him down. The rain will erode the deeds of his life. But that man who sets himself the task of singling out the thread of order from the tapestry will by the decision alone have taken charge of the world and it is only by such taking charge that he will effect a way to dictate the terms of his own fate.
Cormac McCarthy	The Crossing	Deep in each man is the knowledge that something knows of his existence. Something knows, and cannot be fled nor hid from.
Cormac McCarthy	The Road	No lists of things to be done. The day providential to itself. The hour. There is no later. This is later. All things of grace and beauty such that one holds them to one's heart have a common provenance in pain. Their birth in grief and ashes.
Cormac McCarthy	No Country for Old Men	People complain about the bad things that happen to em that they don't deserve but they seldom mention the good. About what they done to deserve them things
Cormac McCarthy	The Road	By day the banished sun circles the earth like a grieving mother with a lamp.
Cormac McCarthy	Blood Meridian, or, the Evening Redness in the West	Men of God and men of war have strange affinities.
Cormac McCarthy	The Road	What would you do if I died?If you died I would want to die too.So you could be with me?Yes. So I could be with you.Okay.
Cormac McCarthy	The Road	Query: How does the never to be differ from what never was?
Cormac McCarthy	Child of God	At one time in the world there were woods that no one owned
Cormac McCarthy	The Road	Can you do it? When the time comes? When the time comes there will be no time. Now is the time. Curse God and die.
Cormac McCarthy	Blood Meridian, or, the Evening Redness in the West	He never sleeps, the judge. He is dancing, dancing. He says that he will never die.
Cormac McCarthy	I don't know why I started writing. I don't know why anybody does it. Maybe they're bored, or failures at something else.
Cormac McCarthy	No Country for Old Men	You keep runnin that mouth and I'm goin to take you back there and screw you.
Cormac McCarthy	No Country for Old Men	If the rule you followed brought you to this, of what use was the rule?
Cormac McCarthy	Blood Meridian, or the Evening Redness in the West	There is no such joy in the tavern as upon the road thereto.
Cormac McCarthy	The Road	When one has nothing left make ceremonies out of the air and breathe upon them.
Cormac McCarthy	The Road	Perhaps in the world's destruction it would be possible at last to see how it was made. Oceans, mountains. The ponderous counterspectacle of things ceasing to be. The sweeping waste, hydroptic and coldly secular. The silence.
Cormac McCarthy	All The Pretty Horses	He said that those who have endured some misfortune will always be set apart but that it is just that misfortune which is their gift and which is their strength.
Cormac McCarthy	Blood Meridian, or the Evening Redness in the West	This is the nature of war, whose stake is at once the game and the authority and the justification. Seen so, war is the truest form of divination. It is the testing of one's will and the will of another within that larger will which because it binds them is therefore forced to select. War is the ultimate game because war is at last a forcing of the unity of existence.War is god.
Cormac McCarthy	No Country for Old Men	I think by the time you're grown you're as happy as you're goin to be. You'll have good times and bad times, but in the end you'll be about as happy as you was before. Or as unhappy. I've knowed people that just never did get the hang of it.
Cormac McCarthy	No Country for Old Men	Ever step you take is forever. You cant make it go away. None of it. You understand what I'm sayin?
Cormac McCarthy	No Country for Old Men	You never know what worse luck your bad luck has saved you from.
Cormac McCarthy	The Road	You forget what you want to remember, and you remember what you want to forget.
Cormac McCarthy	All the Pretty Horses	Scars have the strange power to remind us that our past is real.
Cormac McCarthy	Blood Meridian, or, the Evening Redness in the West	Whatever in creation exists without my knowledge exists without my consent.
Cormac McCarthy	The Road	Nobody wants to be here and nobody wants to leave.
Cormac McCarthy	The Road	Once there were brook trout in the streams in the mountains. You could see them standing in the amber current where the white edges of their fins wimpled softly in the flow. They smelled of moss in your hand. Polished and muscular and torsional. On their backs were vermiculate patterns that were maps of the world in its becoming. Maps and mazes. Of a thing which could not be put back. Not be made right again. In the deep glens where they lived all things were older than man and they hummed of mystery.

Darkness implacable. The blind dogs of the sun in their running. The crushing black vacuum of the universe. And somewhere two hunted animals trembling like ground-foxes in their cover. Borrowed time and borrowed world and borrowed eyes with which to sorrow it.
Cormac McCarthy	Blood Meridian, or, the Evening Redness in the West	The truth about the world, he said, is that anything is possible. Had you not seen it all from birth and thereby bled it of its strangeness it would appear to you for what it is, a hat trick in a medicine show, a fevered dream, a trance bepopulate with chimeras having neither analogue nor precedent, an itinerant carnival, a migratory tentshow whose ultimate destination after many a pitch in many a mudded field is unspeakable and calamitous beyond reckoning.The universe is no narrow thing and the order within it is not constrained by any latitude in its conception to repeat what exists in one part in any other part. Even in this world more things exist without our knowledge than with it and the order in creation which you see is that which you have put there, like a string in a maze, so that you shall not lose your way. For existence has its own order and that no man's mind can compass, that mind itself being but a fact among others.
Cormac McCarthy	The Road	Just remember that the things you put into your head are there forever, he said. You might want to think about that.You forget some things, dont you?Yes. You forget what you want to remember and you remember what you want to forget.
Cormac McCarthy	Blood Meridian, or, the Evening Redness in the West	War was always here. Before man was, war waited for him. The ultimate trade awaiting its ultimate practitioner.
Cormac McCarthy	No Country for Old Men	You think when you wake up in the mornin yesterday don't count. But yesterday is all that does count. What else is there? Your life is made out of the days it’s made out of. Nothin else.
Cormac McCarthy	The Road	What's the bravest thing you ever did?He spat in the road a bloody phlegm. Getting up this morning, he said.
Cormac McCarthy	All the Pretty Horses	Between the wish and the thing the world lies waiting.
Cormac McCarthy	The Road	You have my whole heart. You always did.
Cormac McCarthy	The Road	He knew only that his child was his warrant. He said: If he is not the word of God God never spoke.
Cormac McCarthy	The Road	If trouble comes when you least expect it then maybe the thing to do is to always expect it.
Cormac McCarthy	The Road	You have to carry the fire."I don't know how to."Yes, you do."Is the fire real? The fire?"Yes it is."Where is it? I don't know where it is."Yes you do. It's inside you. It always was there. I can see it.
Cormac McCarthy	All the Pretty Horses	I can normally tell how intelligent a man is by how stupid he thinks I am.
Cormac McCarthy	The Road	Borrowed time and borrowed world and borrowed eyes with which to sorrow it.
Cormac McCarthy	All the Pretty Horses	He stood at the window of the empty cafe and watched the activites in the square and he said that it was good that God kept the truths of life from the young as they were starting out or else they'd have no heart to start at all.
Cormac McCarthy	Blood Meridian, or, the Evening Redness in the West	Your heart's desire is to be told some mystery. The mystery is that there is no mystery.
Cormac McCarthy	The Road	When you die it's the same as if everybody else did too.
Cormac McCarthy	Blood Meridian, or, the Evening Redness in the West	When the lambs is lost in the mountain, he said. They is cry. Sometime come the mother. Sometime the wolf.
Cormac McCarthy	The Road	If only my heart were stone.
Cormac McCarthy	Blood Meridian, or, the Evening Redness in the West	A legion of horribles, hundreds in number, half naked or clad in costumes attic or biblical or wardrobed out of a fevered dream with the skins of animals and silk finery and pieces of uniform still tracked with the blood of prior owners, coats of slain dragoons, frogged and braided cavalry jackets, one in a stovepipe hat and one with an umbrella and one in white stockings and a bloodstained wedding veil and some in headgear or cranefeathers or rawhide helmets that bore the horns of bull or buffalo and one in a pigeontailed coat worn backwards and otherwise naked and one in the armor of a Spanish conquistador, the breastplate and pauldrons deeply dented with old blows of mace or sabre done in another country by men whose very bones were dust and many with their braids spliced up with the hair of other beasts until they trailed upon the ground and their horses' ears and tails worked with bits of brightly colored cloth and one whose horse's whole head was painted crimson red and all the horsemen's faces gaudy and grotesque with daubings like a company of mounted clowns, death hilarious, all howling in a barbarous tongue and riding down upon them like a horde from a hell more horrible yet than the brimstone land of Christian reckoning, screeching and yammering and clothed in smoke like those vaporous beings in regions beyond right knowing where the eye wanders and the lip jerks and drools.
Cormac McCarthy	No Country for Old Men	The point is there ain't no point.
Cormac McCarthy	The Road	If you break little promises, you'll break big ones.
Cormac McCarthy	Blood Meridian, or, the Evening Redness in the West	A man's at odds to know his mind cause his mind is aught he has to know it with. He can know his heart, but he dont want to. Rightly so. Best not to look in there. It aint the heart of a creature that is bound in the way that God has set for it. You can find meanness in the least of creatures, but when God made man the devil was at his elbow. A creature that can do anything. Make a machine. And a machine to make the machine. And evil that can run itself a thousand years, no need to tend it.
